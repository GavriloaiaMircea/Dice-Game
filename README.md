# Dicee Game

## About

The Dicee Game is a simple web application that simulates the roll of two dice, determining a winner based on which die has the higher value. This project serves as a practice for basic web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Simulate Dice Rolls:** The game generates random numbers for two dice and displays the result.
- **Winner Determination:** The application compares the values of the two dice to determine the winner (Player 1 or Player 2). If both dice have the same value, it declares a draw.
- **Interactive and Engaging:** The dice images and results update dynamically with each page reload, providing an engaging user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The game layout is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling for the game interface, including responsive design elements.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the random dice roll logic and DOM manipulation to display results.

## How to Play

1. **Load the Application:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. **Roll the Dice:** Each time the page is loaded or refreshed, the two dice will "roll" and display random values.
3. **View the Result:** The game will automatically display the result, showing which player won, or if it's a draw.
